# Web Scrapping

- This repository is a demonstration of my skill to obtain data from websites that may be relevant for data analysis and further processing to get business insight.

## Tools Used

As a personal preference, I use Python modules that include:

- BeautifulSoup: to parse ***HTML*** and ***XML*** documents, such that I extract data from the websites.
- requests: to make specified HTTP requests to given URLS
- Selenium: to provide umbrella for automating web browsers. Enables interaction with web browsers, distributing browser allocation and implememnting W3C WebDriver Specificattion.


### Future Goal on Web Scrapping

- I intend to have live data pipelines to channel data from a live website clean it and save it. Stay Tuned!
